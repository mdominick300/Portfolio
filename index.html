                <p>My name is Matthew Dominick and I am an aspiring full stack web developer! Currently enrolled in a 6 month boot camp through UNCC. After completion I hope to get a job in a related field.</p>

                 <p>The time I spend not doing homework for this class is spent watching tv, playing with my dog Echo, and watching a lot of football. I am in way too many fantasy football leagues. Wish I could say I am winning them all but I am not. My favorite football team is the Steelers. During mt free time I am now working on learning different coding languages to better myself in the field. Currently I am the master of none but with a lot of work I hope to master at least a few soon.
